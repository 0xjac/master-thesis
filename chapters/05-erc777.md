# ERC777, A New Advanced Token Standard For Ethereum Tokens

ERC777 is advertised as a a new advanced token standard for Ethereum tokens. It is the result of the work of a collaboration between Jordi Baylina from the White Hat Group and Giveth, Jacques Dafflon and Thomas Shababi.

Creating a new standard requires careful considerations. Many aspects must be considered such as security, usability, compatibility with the existing ecosystem and backward compatibility with existing ERC20 infrastructure.

## View Functions

The view functions in ERC777 have been taken from ERC20. Since those functions do not modify the state, they can be used interchangeably for both standards without creating conflicts. The only constraint is that the information returned by these functions must represent the same entity.

Specifically the `name`, `symbol`, `totalSupply` and `balanceOf` functions are kept. The differences with ERC20 is that the cosmetic `name` and `symbol` function are now mandatory. In addition there are more strict constraints on the value returned by calls to the `totalSupply` and `balanceOf` functions.

## Decimals

The ERC20 `decimal` function is notoriously absent from the view functions listed above. As previously explained, a variable `decimals` value is problematic. For this reason the `decimals` has been set at a fixed value of $18$.
