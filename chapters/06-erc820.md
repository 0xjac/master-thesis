# ERC820: Pseudo-introspection Registry Contract

ERC820 is the standard defining the registry used by ERC777 to let addresses---regular accounts and contracts---register the address of a contract implementing the required interface for them. Within the context of ERC777, any address may register a `TokensSender` interface and a `TokensRecipient` interface which are the interfaces for the `tokensToSend` hook and the `tokensReceived` hook respectively. This allows the token contract to know where the implementation of the hook is located and to execute it.

In addition the token contract itself must register its own address as implementing the `ERC777Token` interface which corresponds to the interface any ERC777-compliant token contract must implement. In addition if the ERC777 token is actually an ERC20-ERC777 hybrid token, it must register the `ERC20Token` interface as well, and if the token contract has a switch to disable ERC20 or ERC777 functions, then the contract must dynamically register and unregister its address for the corresponding interfaces.

## First Attempt, The ERC165: Standard Interface Detection

ERC165 was created on January 23^rd^ 2018 and finalized on February 21^st^ the same year. It is a simple and short specification which allows to interact with a contract directly to detect if the contract implements a specific function. While this standard could be used for ERC777 to detect if a recipient contract implements the `tokensReceived` hook, it is very limited in that only contracts and not regular accounts can use the hook and it does not allow contracts to delegate the implementation of the hook to a proxy contract.

This standard has significant drawbacks which as it is, would automatically make ERC777 incompatible with all existing contracts, including \gls{multisig} which can hold large sums of ether and tokens and whose migration to a new contract is both is a sensible subject both from a security and a safety point of view if people are not careful. Hence it was decided a better alternative should be used.

## Second Attempt, The ERC672: ReverseENS Pseudo-Introspection, or standard interface detection

ERC 672: ReverseENS Pseudo-Introspection, or standard interface detection \citep{erc672} was the second attempt at creating a better solution which could fulfill the primary motivation behind ERC777: Designing a system---such as a registry---that given a contract recipient, the token contract would be able to find the address of some contract---the recipient or other---which implements a function with the logic to notify the recipient contract such that the tokens are not locked.

This first attempt relied on \gls{ens} and implementing a reverse \gls{ens} lookup through a registry contract. Overtime however we came to realize this attempt may be overly complicated unsuitable for security reasons. Indeed, this solution relies on \gls{ens} and interactions with \gls{ens} complicate the task of resolving the interface. Furthermore, \gls{ens} is still controlled by a multi-signature contract and theoretically with enough of the keys the system could be corrupted.

## Final Attempt, The Need For The ERC820 Registry

At this point, the need for a separate independent registry became clear. This is where from ERC820 was born. From the ERC820 standard itself:

> [It] defines a universal registry smart contract where any address (contract or regular account) can register which interface it supports and which smart contract is responsible for its implementation \citep{erc820}.

This solution offers solves the issues of the attempts from ERC165 and ERC672. Namely, it can be used by both contracts and regular accounts, it does not rely on \gls{ens} and therefore it is much simpler and does not inherit any of the trust or security concerns from \gls{ens}.

## ERC165 Compatibility

Furthermore, the ERC820 registry is compatible with ERC165 and is able to act as a cache for ERC165, thus saving gas when querying for an interface. More than just saving gas, one can query the ERC820 registry to find out if a contract implements an interface and use dynamic values for the interface to query without having to worry or check if the interface is an ERC165 interface or an ERC820 interface.

### Caching ERC165 Interfaces

Caching with respect to ERC165 is rather simple. Since the code of a contract is immutable, once a contract is deployed with a given interface it cannot change the interface over time. The only times the interface can change is when the contract is created and when the contract is destroyed. In those cases, the cache needs to be manually updated, as there is no automatic cache invalidation or cache update process. This is an explicit choice to keep the registry simple and keep the gas consumption low. The section \ref{} describes the function needed to update the cache.

## Registry Interface

The registry exposes five main functions as part of its interface with an additional three functions specific to ERC165. These three functions are used internally as part of the main functions but can also be used directly if needed.

### Interface Identifier

Each interface has a unique identifier, which is the `keccak256` hash of the interface name. This name is just an arbitrary name decided by the implementer of the interface. The ERC820 standard does defines some rules for interface names. First the name of interfaces for a specific \gls{erc} must be of the form `ERC###XXXXX` where `###` is the \gls{erc} number and `XXXXX` is the actual name for the interface. As an example, for an ERC777 token the interface name is `ERC777Token` which indicates this is part of the ERC777 standard and it is the `Token` interface. Alike, The `ERC777TokensRecipient` is the `TokensRecipient` interface for ERC777.

Other interfaces for private use are free to define their interface name freely but those name must not conflict with names for \glspl{erc}. One recommendation is to prefix the interface name with the name of the company or product related to the interface. Ultimately, there is no central authority or enforcement of any kind---externally or internally in the code of the registry---to ensure those rules are respected. Developers should follow the standard and if they deviate from it and do not respect it, they run the risk of their \gls{dapp} not working or suddenly breaking down.

Since all interfaces are hashed using `keccak256` they are all 256 bits, i.e thirty-two bytes long, with the exception of ERC165 interfaces which are only four bytes long. This difference of hash length is the property used to detected whether an interface is related to ERC165 or ERC820. Specifically, all functions expects thirty-two bytes parameters---i.e parameters of type `bytes32`. Since Solidity pads parameters with zeroes, a four bytes parameters is automatically padded to thirty-two bytes with twenty-eight zeroes and those zeroes are used to detect if the interface is related to ERC165. The listing \ref{lst:erc820ifacedetection} shows the implantation for this logic in the ERC820 registry.

```{caption="The logic use to detect if an interface is related to ERC820 or ERC165 in the ERC820 registry." label="lst:erc820ifacedetection" language=solidity}
/// @notice Checks whether the hash is a ERC165 interface (ending with 28 zeroes) or not.
/// @param _interfaceHash The hash to check.
/// @return `true` if the hash is a ERC165 interface (ending with 28 zeroes), `false` otherwise.
function isERC165Interface(bytes32 _interfaceHash) internal pure returns (bool) {
    return _interfaceHash & 0x00000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF == 0;
}
```

### Lookup

The `getInterfaceImplementer` is the function used to lookup the address of the contract implementing a given interface for a specific address. It takes as first parameter the address for which to lookup the implementation and as second parameter the hash of the interface name to be queried.

If the interface is four bytes long and part of ERC165, then the registry will first look in its cache and then directly with the specified address---using ERC165---to lookup if the address implements the interface. If it does, then the address itself is returned otherwise the \gls{0x} is returned. With ERC165, since it does not support the concept of proxy contract, only the address passed as parameter or the \gls{0x} can be returned and if the address passed is not a contract then the returned value is always the \gls{0x}.

Furthermore in this scenario, if the lookup is called as part of a transaction and the cache is uninitialized, then the cache will automatically be updated. This implies a slight increase in gas cost for the first transaction, however future transaction will consume less gas as they will rely on the cache.

If the interface is a full thirty-two bytes long, then the function will return the address from an internal double mapping. This double mapping relies on the internal `mapping` type of Solidity which returns the default value for the type of the mapping value if the key is not present. As the mapping value is of type `address` it returns the \gls{0x} by default if there is no entry in the double mapping for a given address and interface hash. If a specific address is present however then this address is returned. Overall this means that if the returned address is the \gls{0x} then the given address does not have a contract implementing the interface, if the address is different then it is the address implementing the interface for the given address. If the given address and the address implementing the interface are the same, then it means the given address which implements the interface for itself.
