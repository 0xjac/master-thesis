# ERC820, Pseudo-introspection Registry contract

ERC820 is the standard defining the registry used by ERC777 to let addresses---regular accounts and contracts---register the address of a contract implementing the required interface for them. Within the context of ERC777, any address may register a `TokensSender` interface and a `TokensRecipient` interface which are the interfaces for the `tokensToSend` hook and the `tokensReceived` hook respectively. This allows the token contract to know where the implementation of the hook is located and to execute it.

In addition the token contract itself must register its own address as implementing the `ERC777Token` interface which corresponds to the interface any ERC777-compliant token contract must implement. In addition if the ERC777 token is actually an ERC20-ERC777 hybrid token, it must register the `ERC20Token` interface as well, and if the token contract has a switch to disable ERC20 or ERC777 functions, then the contract must dynamically register and unregister its address for the corresponding interfaces.

## ERC165: Standard Interface Detection

ERC165 was created on January 23^rd^ 2018 and finalized on February 21^st^ the same year. It is a simple and short specification which allows to interact with a contract directly to detect if the contract implements a specific function. While this standard could be used for ERC777 to detect if a recipient contract implements the `tokensReceived` hook, it is very limited in that only contracts and not regular accounts can use the hook and it does not allow contracts to delegate the implementation of the hook to a proxy contract.

This standard has significant drawbacks which as it is, would automatically make ERC777 incompatible with all existing contracts, including \gls{multisig} which can hold large sums of ether and tokens and whose migration to a new contract is both is a sensible subject both from a security and a safety point of view if people are not careful. Hence it was decided a better alternative should be used.

## ERC672: ReverseENS Pseudo-Introspection, or standard interface detection

ERC 672: ReverseENS Pseudo-Introspection, or standard interface detection \citep{erc672} was the second attempt at creating a better solution which could fulfill the primary motivation behind ERC777: Designing a system---such as a registry---that given a contract recipient, the token contract would be able to find the address of some contract---the recipient or other---which implements a function with the logic to notify the recipient contract such that the tokens are not locked.

This first attempt relied on \gls{ens} and implementing a reverse \gls{ens} lookup through a registry contract. Overtime however we came to realize this attempt may be overly complicated unsuitable for security reasons. Indeed, this solution relies on \gls{ens} and interactions with \gls{ens} complicate the task of resolving the interface. Furthermore, \gls{ens} is still controlled by a multi-signature contract and theoretically with enough of the keys the system could be corrupted.

## Need For A Registry

At this point, the need for a separate independent registry became clear. This is where from ERC820 was born. From the ERC820 standard itself:

> [It] defines a universal registry smart contract where any address (contract or regular account) can register which interface it supports and which smart contract is responsible for its implementation \citep{erc820}.

This solution offers solves the issues of the attempts from ERC165 and ERC672. Namely, it can be used by both contracts and regular accounts, it does not rely on \gls{ens} and therefore it is much simpler and does not inherit any of the trust or security concerns from \gls{ens}.

## ERC165 Compatibility

Furthermore, the ERC820 registry is compatible with ERC165 and is able to act as a cache for ERC165, thus saving gas when querying for an interface. More than just saving gas, one can query the ERC820 registry to find out if a contract implements an interface and use dynamic values for the interface to query without having to worry or check if the interface is an ERC165 interface or an ERC820 interface.
