Ethereum decentralized computing
Ethereum is decentralized platform running on a custom built blockchain launched on July 30th 2015. Unlike more traditional crypto-currencies, Ethereum is a computing platform with a Turing-complete programming language used to create and execute arbitrary pieces of code known as smart contracts.

In this thesis describes how the power of smarts contracts is leveraged to have fast transactions despite the slowness of the blockchain.
